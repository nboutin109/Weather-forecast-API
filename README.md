## Code Overview
<p>On startup, the user interface is created from the index.html page and styled with the included .css file and Bootstrap. The script.js page then runs a single function to search for weather data from New York City with multiple AJAX calls and changes the HTML values on the page. The same function executes for a different city whenever the search button is clicked.</p>
